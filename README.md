# CreditCardFraudDetection

The challenge is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

Major Challenges while working on Credit Card Fraud detection are :
1. Large Dataset and the model build must be fast enough to respond to the scam in time.
2.Imbalanced Data i.e most of the transactions (99.8%) are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones.
3.Data availability as the data is mostly private for protecting the privacy of the user the dimensionality of the data can be reduced
4.Misclassified Data can be another major issue, as not every fraudulent transaction is caught and reported.
5.Adaptive techniques used against the model by the scammers.
